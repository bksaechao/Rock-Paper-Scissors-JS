## Javascript Practice Challenge
<p>This Javascript coding challenge was a mini group project assigned during my coding bootcamp. In an attempt to review my JS knowledge, I have challenged myself to re-create this mini game solo with as little resources as possible.<p>

## *(Follow up notes)*
<ul>
  <li>
    Although I've already done this assignment before, there was much more effort put into it this time around.
  </li>
  <li>
    During my previous attempt only the bare minimum of code was applied to accomplish the task with no styling, interaction, error handling, etc..
  </li>
  <li>
    A lot of the basic knowlege still stuck with me so I decided to have more fun with it and tried to make it more interactive with extra functions and a little more styling.
  </li>
</ul>
